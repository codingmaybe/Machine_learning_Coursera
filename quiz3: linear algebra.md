1. Let two matrices be A = [1 -4;-2 1], B = [0 3;5 8]. What is A+B?

* [1 7;7 9]
* **[1 -1;3 9]**
* [1 -7;-7 -7]
* [1 -1;7 9]

2. Let x = [2;7;4;1]. What is 1/2 * x?

* [1 7/2 2 1/2]
* [4 14 8 2]
* **[1 7/2 2 1/2]**
* [4 14 8 2]

3. Let u be a 3-dimensional vector, where specifically u = [2;1;8]. What is u'(Transpose)?

* [2;1;8]
* [8;1;2]
* [8 1 2]
* **[2 1 8]**

4. Let u and v be 3-dimensional vectors, where specifically y = [4;-4;-3] and v = [4;2;4]. What is u'v? (Hint: u' is a
1x3 dimensional matrix, and v can also be seen as a 3x1
matrix. The answer you want can be obtained by taking
the matrix product of u' and v.) Do not add brackets to your answer.

* **-4**

5. Let A and B be 3x3 (square) matrices. Which of the following
must necessarily hold true? Check all that apply.

* If C = A * B, then C is a 6 * 6 matrix.
* A * B * A = B * A * B
* **A+B = B+A**
* **If v is a 3 dimensional vector, then A * B * v is a 3 dimensional vector.**
